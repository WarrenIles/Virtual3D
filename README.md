# Virtual3D

In this project, I intend to create a virtual three dimensional display, using face tracking for head tracking. Utilizing the Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a persons x, y, and z location relative to a webcam. Accoding to the position of the user, the virtual tunnel display will be updated to give a 3d effect.
